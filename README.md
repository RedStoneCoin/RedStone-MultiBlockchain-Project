# RedStone-MultiBlockchain-Project

## How it will work?
How Redstone can solve sharding.
For our implementation of sharding, the transaction will be sent from the main wallet chain, and it will 
be transferred to the chain with the least amount of transactions
present. The miner will be able to choose what chain to mine, and most will choose the chain with most 
transactions, since they get paid for it. 
But people who choose the chain with the least transactions will get paid better (eg. if is 30% less load, 30% better
paid). We want three chains because transactions will go through quicker and smoother, therefore we reduce transaction times. 
This just a theory for sharding. Redstone is for the time being a normal coin, but I will try to implement this.
